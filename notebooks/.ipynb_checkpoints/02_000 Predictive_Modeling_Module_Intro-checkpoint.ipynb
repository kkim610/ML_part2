    "## What you will learn\n",
    "This module will give an example of a typical predictive modeling pipeline developed using tabular data (data that can be structured in a 2-dimensional table). <br> We will present this pipeline in a progressive way.<br> First, we will make an analysis of the dataset used.<br> Subsequently, we will train our first predictive pipeline with a subset of the dataset.<br> Then, we will give particular attention to the type of data, numerical and categorical, that our model has to handle.<br> Finally, we will extend our pipeline to use mixed types of data, i.e. numerical and categorical data."
